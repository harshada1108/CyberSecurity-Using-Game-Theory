# CyberSecurity-Using-Game-Theory
Cybersecurity Threat Modeling using Game Theory
Developed a strategic cybersecurity framework leveraging Stackelberg game theory to analyze attacker-defender interactions. Implemented payoff matrix construction, zero-sum game solving, and optimal defense strategy selection using numpy, scipy.optimize, and linear programming.

Data-Driven Attack Pattern Analysis
Built a synthetic attack dataset with attributes such as severity, success rate, and target value. Used K-Means clustering (sklearn) and data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn) to detect patterns and classify attack behaviors, enhancing proactive defense mechanisms.

Dynamic Threat Response System
Designed an AI-driven adaptive defense mechanism that clusters attacks, predicts optimal defense strategies, and dynamically adjusts responses. Integrated standardized scaling (sklearn.preprocessing) and probabilistic defense selection, improving cyber resilience through real-time decision-making.
